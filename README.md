# Housing-Price-US-Regional-Analysis
Inflation-adjusted data of US housing price analysis by region. Explore trends and differences in average prices over 20 years.

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of housing prices in the United States, with a primary focus on comparing average sales prices across four distinct regions: the Midwest, South, West, and Northeast. The research utilizes not seasonally adjusted quarterly data, sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), encompassing all transaction home sales prices.

Key Project Highlights:

Inflation Adjustment: To ensure accurate and meaningful insights, the dataset is meticulously adjusted for the effects of inflation, with the base year set as quarter 1 of 2010.

Exploratory Analysis: The study employs various methods, including descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each of the regions under consideration. These techniques provide a comprehensive understanding of the data's characteristics and trends.

Hypothesis Testing: The primary research question examined is whether the average sales price of houses has remained consistent across the four U.S. regions over the past two decades.

Post-Hoc Testing: In addition to ANOVA, post-hoc tests using Bonferroni and TukeyHSD methods are performed to identify specific regions where differences in the mean sales prices are significant.
